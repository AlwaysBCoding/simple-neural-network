# Simple Neural Network

This is a package for learning about neural networks through a simplified example. There are many other better packages for production use.

# Chapters

The `chapters` folder contains a walk through for how to build up a neural network, starting with a simple linear classifier.

# Src

The source for a simple neural network that can have a variable number of layers each with a variable number of neurons can be found in `src`.

# Examples

There are examples using the code in `src` for classifying XOR and MNIST image data. There is also an html file for visualizing how a linear classifier adjusts to classify AND.
